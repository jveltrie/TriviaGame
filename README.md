Trivia Game Homework
In this trivia game, I wanted to have the player go through a series of questions about animals and try to answer then within 16 seconds. I was able to get to the first question but it would not move on to the next question. It would state if you answered the question correctly and the timer was counting down. I was not sure how to do the reset since I had such a difficult just trying to get one thing to run.
